Set Up
======

The bot has a generally easy setup. You can use the autosetup, or you can set it up
yourself which is easy to do. The autosetup is not available for everything, however
if you want a specific channel or role for something, **DON'T USE AUTOSETUP**. Auto
Setup creates roles and channels for things, not using extisting channels. This is 
your only warning. If you do decide to autosetup **(generally for small servers)**
use our ``/autosetup-<setup>`` command; *<setup>* is the type of setup.
